\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This document is a supplement to the general instructions for *ACL authors. It contains instructions for using the \LaTeX{} style file for ACL 2023.
The document itself conforms to its own specifications, and is, therefore, an example of what your manuscript should look like.
These instructions should be used both for papers submitted for review and for final versions of accepted papers.
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes are inserted with the \verb|\footnote| command.\footnote{This is a footnote.}

\subsection{Tables and figures}

\subsection{t-SNE Visualizations}

We used the parameters on \cite{GOVE202287}.

\subsection{Citations}



% Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
% We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
% You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
% You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
% You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\section*{Limitations}
ACL 2023 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.
The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.

While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
Our review work strictly adheres to the ACL Ethics Policy.\footnote{\url{https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics}}. We acknowledge that while our evaluation contributes to the understanding of language model behaviors and their applications, it does not introduce novel methodologies or data. We have carefully considered the ethical implications of our work, ensuring that our analyses do not misrepresent capabilities, and we recognize the importance of responsible AI development and the potential impact of language technologies on society. Our work aims to provide a comprehensive, unbiased evaluation to foster informed discussions within the research community. This review has been conducted with an emphasis on transparency and reproducibility, encouraging the ethical advancement of natural language processing research.
